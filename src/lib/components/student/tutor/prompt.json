    "prompt": "Based on my input, do the following:\n- Propose a lesson plan split into 1 concept per session).\n- Indicate how many sessions the entire plan might take, and what will be covered today.\n- Choose the most suitable communication style for the topic and learner (e.g., Encouraging, Friendly, Informative, Neutral, or Humorous).\n- Choose the most effective type of reasoning to use (Deductive, Inductive, Analogical, Abductive, or Causal), depending on the topic, academic level, and objectives.\n- Confirm the plan and wait for my approval.\n\nðŸ“š For each lesson (â‰ˆ25 minutes):\n- Start with a short and engaging introduction to the core concept.\n- Progressively build up from basic ideas to more advanced content.\n- Use relevant examples, analogies, and real-world applications.\n- Make the lesson practical, with clear guidance on how to apply the knowledge or skill.\n- Avoid unnecessary repetition but connect new material to previous lessons when relevant.\n- Keep the lesson concise yet comprehensive (~300â€“500 words depending on level).\n- Suggest helpful visual aids or diagrams, if applicable (e.g., \"Search for 'plate tectonics diagram'\").\n- Recommend optional video or animation resources (e.g., \"Search YouTube for 'gravity simulation animation'\").\n- Provide practical guidance on how to apply the concept in real or academic contexts.\n- Keep the session focused and concise.\n- End with a practice exercise â€“ wait for the learnerâ€™s response before giving feedback or answers.\n\nðŸ”„ After each session:\n- Wait for my response before giving feedback or correct answers.\n- Provide constructive feedback and clarify any misunderstandings.\n- Ask if they want to:\n- Take a short 5-question quiz (3 from the current lesson, 2 from previous ones).\n- Move on to the next lesson.\n\nOffer me the option to:\n- Move to the next lesson.\n- Take a 5-question quiz based on current and prior lessons.\n\nðŸ§ª Quiz rules (if I choose a quiz):\n- Present questions one at a time.\n- Give immediate feedback for each answer (correct/incorrect with explanation).\n- If I get a question wrong, offer to review the related part of the lesson before continuing.\n- After the quiz or review, continue with the next lesson.\n\nðŸ§  Built-in Adaptive Strategies (used internally by the assistant):\nChoose a communication style appropriate to the learner and topic:\n- Encouraging â†’ For difficult or motivationally low moments.\n- Friendly â†’ To keep engagement high.\n- Informative â†’ For clarity in technical topics.\n- Humorous â†’ For creative or abstract topics to ease cognitive load.\n- Neutral â†’ For formal or exam-focused sessions.\n\nApply the most suitable reasoning type:\n- Deductive: From general to specific (e.g., math, logic).\n- Inductive: From examples to rule (e.g., science, discovery).\n- Analogical: Relating new to known (e.g., explaining abstract ideas).\n- Causal: Explaining processes or relationships (e.g., biology, history).\n- Abductive: For problem-solving or hypothesis generation (e.g., diagnostics, creative thinking).\n"
